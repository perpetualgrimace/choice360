## Start with better options

Since its founding as a monthly collection of recommended titles more than 50 years ago, Choice has become the go-to source for librarians seeking worthwhile new titles for their collection. Our publication offers 600 reviews every month, identifying the best new books and digital content in academia.

With more than 2,400 institutions served worldwide, Choice is the premier review journal of new academic titles.

### We promote librarianship

Choice is the publishing branch of the Association of College & Research Libraries, a division of the American Library Association. Together, Choice and the ACRL provide professional development tools for librarianship. Our webinars, bibliographic essays, and digital publications help librarians strengthen their skills, and further their careers.
