Geoffrey Smithers, editor in Chief of the Food Science Reference Module, talks about why reference modules are the future of reference publishing and how they provide a cross-disciplinary bridge to the most current digital content. The Food Science module is compiled from relevant Elsevier Major Reference Works in a given subject. Geoffrey and his team curate the content and maintain its relevance through regular reviews and updates. Filled with dynamic links to interrelated subjects and concepts, reference modules enrich research and illuminate the future of reference publishing.
