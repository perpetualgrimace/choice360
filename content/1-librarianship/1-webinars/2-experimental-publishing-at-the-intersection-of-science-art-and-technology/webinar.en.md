### Summary:
This webinar discusses the advantages of sparking convergences and interactions among art, science, and technology within the academy, and highlights how the library can help form the bridge for interdisciplinary collaboration. Professionals working at the intersection of art and new media have been early adopters and innovators in new forms of publishing. Key issues, in addition to the rapidly changing new media for publishing, now include the problem of data rot and the emergence of grey literature as a repository for key innovation. Libraries and publishers find themselves at the nexus of new solutions.

Essential content from this field has been gathered into a new, growing platform from the MIT Press: ARTECA. In this curated space, scholars and practitioners find the resources needed to bridge the once independent disciplines of the arts, sciences, and technology. ARTECA will also be used to experiment in the archiving of grey literature. Any library and its patrons can explore ARTECA fully and freely for 60 days.

Join ACRL and Choice for a lively discussion with Roger Malina, editor of Leonardo and distinguished professor of art and technology and professor of physics at the University of Texas, Dallas, and Jon Ippolito, Codirector of the Still Water Lab and Digital Curation Program at the University of Maine, to discuss how the arts and sciences can be brought together to the benefit of both and to move forward interdisciplinary studies.

### Speakers:
<h4 class="u-no_margin delta">Roger Malina</h4>
Distinguished Professor of Art and Technology and Professor of Physics
University of Texas Dallas

Roger Malina runs the ArtSciLab (https://artscilab.atec.io/) including Experimental Publishing. He is Executive Editor of the Leonardo Publications at MIT Press, which for 50 years has documented work in emerging research fields that connect the sciences and engineering to the arts, design and humanities. He founded two nonprofits, ISAST in San Francisco and OLATS in Paris, which advocate and document the work of artists involved in contemporary science and technology. He served as director of the Observatoire Astronomique de Marseille Provence and was NASA Principal Investigator for the Extreme Ultraviolet Satellite project at the University of California, Berkeley.

#### Jon Ippolito
Professor of New Media and Codirector of the Still Water Lab and Digital Curation Program
University of Maine

Ippolito invents ways to build and sustain networks, a fact that often makes him unpopular with media monopolists, bureaucrats, and other apologists for hierarchic culture. Ippolito works with the Variable Media Network to devise new preservation paradigms to rescue digital culture from obsolescence, and has explored net-native ways to connect online scholarship with ThoughtMesh and Scalar. His book Re-collection, co-authored with Richard Rinehart, argues that digital heritage of the last 30 years will be lost to history without a revolutionary approach to preserving culture.
