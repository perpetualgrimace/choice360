Gans (American Univ.) has been at work on this project related to voter turnout for 34 years. Voter turnout is expressed as an actual record of votes cast as well as percentages of eligible Americans who cast their ballots. With research assistant Mulling, Gans has documented the record in 20-year intervals. The introduction discusses the history in terms of five distinctive trends, beginning with 1788-1855 and ending with 1964-2009. Preceding the volume's chapters is a section covering major events and a synopsis of election law changes. Most of the work consists of data in tabular form, with some graphs. The book presents, for the time frame 1788-1929, the votes for president, state governor, and statewide aggregate votes for US House of Representatives elections; from 1902 forward, the votes in major party primaries for president and governor; and from 1914 forward, the primary and general election overall turnout, along with the partisan vote for US Senate elections (before 1914 senators were chosen by state legislators). For general reference collections, and for political science and history collections in particular, this is a work without peer.
