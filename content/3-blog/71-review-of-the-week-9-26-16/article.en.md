Hundreds of books have been written about this dramatic year, and the final chapter, “It’s Never Stopped Being 1968,” of Boston Globe political columnist Michael Cohen’s history of the presidential campaign that year explains why it remains absorbing. The political climate and issues for the last 50 years have much of their roots in this campaign. In 1968, radicals, conservatives, left and right populists, hawks and doves, minorities, environmentalists, working-class hard hats, and the center mainstream all railed against the liberal center establishment and Washington’s normative politics. Vietnam, race, and cultural challenges occupied center stage. Replace Vietnam with the Middle East, and 2016 exhibits eerie similarities. Nine prospective candidates began the quest for their party’s nomination in 1968 and quickly or more protractedly fell to the wayside. McCarthy’s challenge, Robert Kennedy’s tragic demise, LBJ’s fall, Humphrey’s unhappy crusade, Rockefeller’s failure, Romney’s cameo, Reagan’s stealth advent, Nixon’s resurrection, and George Wallace’s rage are colorfully treated. Theodore H. White’s classic The Making of the President 1968 and Jules Witcover’s five books on the key players’ campaigns remain quintessential, but Cohen’s captivating volume is the new standard.

**Summing Up:** Essential. All readership levels.
