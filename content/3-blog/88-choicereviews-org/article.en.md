It’s been a long time comin’.

With the arrival of June we are pleased to announce the launching of a completely redesigned (link: http://www.choicereviews.org/ text: Choice Reviews Online).  For those of you who have been asking for a simpler, faster, and easier-to-use collection-development tool, I am happy to report that your wait is over.

The new service, now called simply Choice Reviews, was built to respond directly to the many suggestions we received from subscribers.  With their issues in mind, this version has been engineered to work the way that you do, with an intuitive user interface, improved search and discovery features, and data management tools that will save you time and simplify decision-making.

What sets this version of Choice Reviews apart from its predecessors is that it acts like what it is: not so much a journal as a searchable database, containing almost 200,000 reviews of academic titles ranging over the past quarter century.  Like the databases you use commonly, it features a simple search box and uses faceted searches to enable you to filter your results with great precision.  You can build lists, save searches, create alerts, find books in WorldCat, poll faculty on their preferences, and even add titles to your GOBI shopping cart.  And like the other databases your library subscribes to, it is designed to be used by both you and your library patrons—as a source of bibliographic information and critical reviews of works being considered for research projects and/or classroom assignments.  We are especially excited about this latter scenario and hope that you will encourage faculty and students at your university to take advantage of this outstanding resource.

Migrating to a new system always entails a certain amount of inconvenience, but we have tried to minimize the effort you will need to expend in order to get up and running.  First of all, if your institution is a current subscriber to our online service, your account information has already been ported over to the new site.  You can access us at http://choicereviews.org.  If you are the administrator of the account, you will be receiving an email shortly with information about how to create an administrative password.  That’s all there is to it.  Choice Reviews can be used by any member of your institution, either inside your network or remotely.

It is a curious fact that subscriptions to Choice are almost evenly divided between print and digital formats, with only negligible overlap.  That means that if you are reading this letter there is a 50 percent chance you are reading a magazine.  Both formats have their advantages, but in order to introduce our print subscribers to the breadth of information available in the database version, we will shortly be announcing a special offer that we believe you will find highly attractive.  And, if you are planning on attending the ALA Annual Conference later this month in Orlando, please plan on stopping by our booth, #1147, for a demonstration of this remarkable new discovery and reference tool.
