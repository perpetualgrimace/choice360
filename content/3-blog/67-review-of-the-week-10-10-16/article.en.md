This book should be considered a must read by anyone interested in presidential power, secrecy, and law.  Kitrosser (Univ. of Minnesota Law School) frames her discussion and analysis of the presidency within what she calls a “substantive accountability framework,” which is given life through the mechanisms of macro-transparency, accountability tools, and extraordinary prerogative.  She provides a rich and thoughtful review of the conceptual origins of presidential power advocacy and the rationale for employing a substantive accountability framework.  The bulk of her work describes and analyzes how presidential supremacy manifests itself in external and internal matters.  Although Kitrosser does not explicitly address Steven Calabresi and Christopher Yoo’s The Unitary Executive (CH, Jan'09, 46-2937) or Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule’s The Executive Unbound (CH, Dec'11, 49-2361), she does well to tackle the presidential supremacy arguments that those books contain.  Her conclusions on moving forward (e.g., engaging in public outreach, bridging partisan and ideological divides, using accountability tools, and creating new or modifying existing accountability tools) provide readers with interesting and thought-provoking ways to counter the aggressive and imperious forms of presidential supremacy in action.

**Summing Up: **Essential. General readers, upper-division undergraduate students, and above.
