Bunker, a reporter for the Financial Times, offers a fresh interpretation of the Separatists in Europe and North America. New insights abound in this masterful narrative, due in large part to Bunker's extensive use of new and overlooked sources. The riveting tale also explores the significance of maritime trade and navigation, the Russian and North American fur trade, the impact of the era's economic malaise, the consequences associated with the fall of La Rochelle, and James I's untiring efforts to expel the religious dissenters who he believed threatened to foment political and spiritual rebellion. In addition, the author also highlights the contributions of Philip Sidney, Henry Ainsworth, Robert Browne, Thomas Helwys, Matthew Craddock, and other unsung dissenters and Pilgrim leaders. What emerges is a richly nuanced, well-written, and detailed historical saga that explores the dissenters' theological and philosophical beliefs, the Pilgrims' European connections, the Separatists' Leiden exile, and the familiar story of New Plymouth's first decade of struggle and survival.
