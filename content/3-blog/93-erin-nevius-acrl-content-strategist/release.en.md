*Middletown, CT – April 13, 2016:*

Effective immediately, Erin Nevius has been named ACRL content strategist and will report jointly to the ACRL executive director and to the editor and publisher at Choice. Choice (http://choice360.org), a publishing unit of the Association of College and Research Libraries, a division of the American Library Association, is the publisher of Choice, the premier source for reviews of new English-language books and digital resources for academic libraries.

In this role, Erin will identify and acquire content— in a variety of formats, including but not limited to e-learning, books, podcasts, blog posts, etc.—that will inform academic and research librarians. Erin has fifteen years of professional publishing experience acquiring and editing books and working with periodicals and online content for both commercial and not-for-profit publishers. Prior to coming to ACRL, she was an executive editor and then associate director of book publishing at the American Bar Association. Before that, she served as a project editor at Sourcebooks, where she oversaw the acquisition and development of as many as thirty titles annually. Originally from Ohio, Erin studied English and communications at Xavier University, with a concentration in Irish and Celtic literature, and has lived and worked in Chicago for over ten years. She is a voracious reader with a passion for creating and delivering compelling, timely, and practical content.

“Erin brings to this position a substantial knowledge of acquisition and of the publishing process—skills that will be invaluable as we refine our publishing strategies,” said Cummings. "We look forward to her collaboration with Choice staff as we move to expand our publishing program and bring our brand into alignment with that of ACRL."
