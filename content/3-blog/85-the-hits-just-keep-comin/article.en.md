In last month’s editorial I spent some time discussing the core elements of our mission here at Choice: discovery, evaluation, and recommendation. The completely rebuilt (link: http://www.choicereviews.org text: *Choice Reviews*), which launched this past June, exemplifies our commitment to these attributes, particularly in its attention to the experience of the user, and we have been delighted with the initial reactions of our subscribers.

In this same spirit, then, I am pleased (more than pleased!) to be able to announce plans for an important new product coming this winter on the Choice platform: an online service devoted to the review of academic databases. This new service is the fruit of a unique collaboration with (link: http://www.charlestonco.com/ text: The Charleston Company), publishers of *The Charleston Advisor*, and will go by the working title of *CC Advisor* (get it?). The Charleston Company shares with Choice an attention to objectivity and scholarly rigor; its reviews, like ours, are written by experts and edited to exacting standards. Bringing our two teams together on this project exploits our respective competencies and is a logical extension of our reputations and “brands.”

How does the collaboration work? In a series of meetings earlier this summer, editors from both groups gathered in Charleston to hammer out the editorial and production issues surrounding the new service. Reviews in CCA (if you will) will run to a substantial 1,500 to 2,000 words and will be written to a standard editorial template, to simplify discovery and comparisons among competing works.  The Charleston Company will take the lead on the editorial side, drawing on their long experience with the *Advisor*, supplemented by the editorial resources at Choice.  For its part, Choice will undertake to create the product itself, drawing on its recent experience with *Choice Reviews*.  The result will be a subscription service, in database form, that will resemble *Choice Reviews* in terms of search capabilities and user experience, and that will be available on the (link: http://www.choice360.org/ text: Choice platform) either as a stand-alone product or bundled with *Choice Reviews*.

The value of the database format, of course, is that, unlike a journal, the database can be revised, updated, and added to on a regular basis. Thus, far from being a review archive, *CCA* will be a living document reflecting the latest in significant information about the works it reviews.  Our intention is to launch with several hundred reviews, completely revised and updated from recent issues of *The Charleston Advisor*, and thereafter to add as many as 10 to 20 new or revised reviews each month. Work on both the editorial and technical side has already begun, and if all goes well we shall have a working prototype available for the Charleston Conference in November and a full product release in time for the ACRL biannual conference in Baltimore next March.

Speaking for both staffs, I want to tell you how excited we are at the possibilities this collaboration presents.  If you have comments or suggestions about features you would like to see in *CC Advisor*, please don’t hesitate to share them with us!--MC
