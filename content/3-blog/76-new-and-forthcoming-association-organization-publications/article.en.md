Scholarly and professional associations, organizations, and societies produce resources of great value to the academic community, and this feature highlights the new and forthcoming works of such a vital group of publishers.  As is the case with others in *Choice*'s popular "Forthcoming" series, this selected list of titles is designed to provide information about new or soon-to-be-released publications that may support academic curricula and library collections, particularly at the undergraduate level.  The feature highlights forthcoming titles scheduled for publication from late summer 2016 through 2017.

In compiling this list, *Choice* contacted associations and organizations and invited them to submit new title information.  In addition, editors checked new publication catalogs and prepublication announcements for appropriate titles.  The bibliographic information was supplied by publishers or obtained from catalogs and promotional materials; data about the titles include anticipated release date, price, and ISBN when these are known.  Estimated prices are followed by "e."  As in all lists of this type, release dates, prices, and even titles are subject to change at a later date.  Please check with the publisher or your bookseller for the latest information.

*Choice*  extends special thanks to the publishers who supplied and verified information about their new and forthcoming titles.  An alphabetical list of associations and organizations whose works are listed appears at the end of this feature, complete with web addresses and a brief mission statement.
