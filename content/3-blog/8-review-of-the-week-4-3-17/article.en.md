The subtitle of this book perfectly encapsulates its nature as a useful guide to fonts as a key facet within the study of typography. Seddon (a UK-based designer) uses color—in the visual table of contents and the chapters themselves—to make navigation easy. Bringing his own freelance and art-direction experience to the book, the author covers the anatomy of type, terminology, and fundamental typefaces, carefully distilling the information to assure a go-to handbook unencumbered by excess. Be they students or practitioners, readers will find the book easy to use. Jim Krause's Lessons in Typography: Must-Know Typographic Principles Presented through Lessons, Exercises, and Examples (2016) and Ellen Lupton's Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, and Students (2004) are equally useful, but they are more textbook than reference resource. Those seeking to master typography will find Seddon's book invaluable.

**Summing Up: Essential. Lower-division undergraduates, including students in technical programs; professionals.**
