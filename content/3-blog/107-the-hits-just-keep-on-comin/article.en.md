Start with Better Options

With summer in full swing and the academic year looming only a few weeks ahead, you have probably begun to notice some changes going on at Choice.  If you are a subscriber to our digital publication, Choice Reviews, the change is hard to miss, but even print subscribers are now seeing something of a new look about us.  A new logo, a fresh new look in our communications with you, a new attitude.

The change has been a long time in the making, but readers of this column over the past few years have probably noticed our ongoing attempts to distill from our fifty-two-year publishing history a sense of  the core mission of Choice, what it is that we provide the library community, our reason for existence.    This exploration was prompted initially by radical changes in the way libraries acquire materials but latterly by the recognition that the very nature of information publication, delivery, and consumption is changing as well.  We must address these issues if we are to continue to provide value to the library community.

Discovery, evaluation, recommendation.  These are the core elements that have informed our work throughout our history, and now, as we undertake to remake Choice as a publishing unit, not simply a publication, these are the attributes that will guide our programs.  The completely rebuilt Choice Reviews is a prime example.The database continues to serve its principal audience as a collection-development tool, but look more closely.  In its simplicity of design and attention to user experience it is conveying something else: its utility as a bibliographical resource for librarians and scholars alike, its place on the desktop of your students. 

Rebuilding Choice Reviews is only a start, of course.  New products are under development at Choice, and new analytic tools are being contemplated.  We will be discussing these in the months to come.  Central to all of them will be the effort to simplify your work by continuing to do what we do best: evaluating sources and recommending that you begin your own search with a vastly more manageable and appropriate set of resources from which to choose.   It is in recognition of this mission that we have adopted a new “tagline” for Choice: “Start with Better Options.”  Whether identifying new works for your collection, recommending sources to your students, selecting works for deaccession, or benchmarking your collection, Choice tools will help you navigate through the library of Babel that is our lot today and in the end, will make you a stronger resource for your patrons.

Accessing Choice tools and services is the responsibility of our newly redesigned  website, www.choice360.org, and it is here, at last, that our mission and our messaging—our brand attributes—are fully and handsomely exposed.  If you have not had the opportunity to visit the site yet, I hope you will make some time this summer to see what we’ve been up to!
