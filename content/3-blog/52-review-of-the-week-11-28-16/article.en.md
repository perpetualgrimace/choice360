Egyptian archaeologist Hawass and Saleem (radiology, Cairo Univ., Egypt) provide a superb, semi-popular account of the results of CT imaging performed on several New Kingdom Egyptian royal mummies. The book begins with an introduction by Hawass, followed by a chapter discussing radiological imaging and another describing the ancient caches where many of these mummies were found. The next ten chapters cover the results of CT imaging performed on royal mummies from the early-18th-century to the mid-20th-century dynasties, supplemented with historical, archaeological, and, when available, genetic data from extracted DNA. Chapters on objects found with the mummies, mummification practices, and facial features of the mummies conclude the text. Several useful appendixes follow, along with detailed notes and an extensive bibliography. High quality black-and-white images, including many annotated CT scans, are found throughout the volume; also included is a section of 90 color plates. The results are sometimes surprising but always fascinating. Despite the occasional somewhat technical language, this book will be of great interest not only to scholars but to anyone else fascinated by Egyptian mummies.
