Chica lit is a wonderful addition to the literature on Latina/o popular culture. Taking an expansive theoretical approach that includes a critique of neoliberalism and the difficult questions of stereotyping and authenticity, Hedrick (Univ. of Florida) explores the production, content, and reception of this subgenre within chicklit called chica lit. Given that chica lit seeks a space in mainstream chicklit, the author explores the opportunities and challenges of participating in the marketing of difference. Looking at such subjects as denial of structural inequality and the tension that authors experience in their efforts to write something original against the publishing industry’s expectations of an authentic Latina/o that often borders on offensively prejudiced, Hedrick takes the reader through the construction and evolution of the contemporary romance genre, industrial expectations of ethnic female authors, and the possibilities of subverting structural barriers once one’s foot is in the door of this publishing industry. The author includes interviews with many authors, and she also deconstructs plots. The resulting book is a brilliant example of scholarship that explores the difficult yet absolutely necessary effort of being present within the mainstream while maintaining cultural integrity.
