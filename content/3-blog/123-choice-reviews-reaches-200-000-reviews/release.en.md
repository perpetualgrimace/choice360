Middletown, CT – March 3, 2017: 28 years after its launch, the Choice Reviews database today marked the publication of its 200,000th review. The premier source for reviews of academic books, digital media, and Internet resources in higher education, Choice Reviews is a publication of the Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL), a division of the American Library Association. Updated continuously in real time, Choice Reviews provides subscribers with immediate access to a comprehensive archive of reviews representing a quarter-century of scholarship.

The 200,000th review, written by Carol Jamison of Armstrong Atlantic State University, is of *An Old English History of the World*, edited and translated by Malcolm Godden and published by Harvard.  

“This is a real achievement for all of us involved with Choice Reviews, in particular our subject editors and network of reviewers, but also the publishers who send us their books and products, as well as the authors of those works,” said Mark Cummings, editor and publisher of Choice. “These 200,000 reviews constitute a robust discovery tool that can be used by students and faculty to locate key resources in almost any area of academic study.”
