Based on richly detailed local case studies, Elmer endeavors to answer two interrelated questions about witchcraft and witch hunting in early modern England. He seeks to determine those factors that contributed most to fluctuations in witchcraft prosecutions over time and those that led to their eventual disappearance. Building on the scholarship of Ian Bostridge, such as Witchcraft and its Transformation (CH, Jan'98, 35-2853), and Stuart Clark, Thinking with Demons (CH, Jan'98, 35-3004), Elmer (Exeter Univ., UK) similarly argues that these two phenomena cannot be understood without reference to the concomitant political and religious contexts in which they occurred. He contends that in 16th-century England, fears of Catholic witches served to unify its Protestant population; in the 17th century, as the body politic splintered into hostile religious and political camps, witchcraft became an increasingly politicized and polarizing social force. Unsurprisingly, Elmer finds the acute political conflict, such as the Exclusion Crisis, saw an upsurge in witchcraft trials. Meanwhile, he attributes the decline of witchcraft prosecutions in the early 18th century less to the rise of scientific skepticism and judicial reform than to the growing reluctance of Whig politicians to countenance accusations. Meticulously researched, this is a must read for students of witchcraft and early modern society in general.
