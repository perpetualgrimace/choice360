A nearly obligatory end-of-year activity at journals such as ours is the publication of a “Best Books of” article or, failing that, the more personal “Staff Picks for the Best Books of.” Fortunately, our Outstanding Academic Titles list (last month’s edition) neatly discharges that obligation, as most of us here at Choice are far too busy editing reviews of books to actually read them, let alone have a favorite.

But memory is short, and by February many of our readers have long forgotten the lists they made over the holidays, including the one about reading this or that fascinating book from the “Best Books of” article they saw in that journal whose name they cannot remember either. Oh, well.

Last fall I wrote a short piece on some interesting bookstores I have visited, and at that time, wisely discerning that the day would come when a deadline loomed and I needed a topic for my monthly editorial pronto, I polled the staff as to their own favorites for quirky, one-of-a-kind bookstores. So here, as a public service to you (and a boon to me), is a brief list of a few of their choices.

Anne Doherty: “As a native Iowan, I would be remiss if I didn’t urge travelers to take a detour off Interstate 80 and visit Prairie Lights in Iowa City. It shouldn’t surprise readers that the home to the renowned Iowa Writers’ Workshop also boasts a wonderful bookstore with a decidedly literary bent. Prairie Lights hosts readings by visiting authors and serves as the de facto college bookstore for many of the University of Iowa’s literature and creative writing courses”: (link: http://www.prairielights.com).

Pamela Sandstrom: “I adore Hyde Brothers Booksellers in our former hometown of Fort Wayne, Indiana, because academic librarians and all manner of bibliophiles never leave disappointed. Or depressed, thinking that the era of the BOOK might be passing into history. Throughout the cramped quarters of this Hoosier treasure, all seems chaos until one grasps the order or one of the savants who works there. Invariably they find whatever you›re looking for, or agree to hunt it down or suggest something akin. Its benign storefront is disarming”: (link: http://www.hydebros.com).

Tom Radko: “Visitors to the Maine coast should be aware that Bill Henderson, the founder of independent publisher Pushcart Press, has opened (link: http://weeklypacket.com/multimedia/photos/2015/aug/20/worlds-smallest-bookstore/#.VdyyzEVQPV1 text: Pushcart Bookstore) — dubbed the “World’s Smallest Bookstore”—in Sedgwick, Maine. According to the Penobscot Bay Press, the 9’×12’ bookstore carries Pushcart Press titles as well as a selection of used classics. The store resides atop Christy Hill in Sedgwick, an hour or so by car from Bar Harbor, but shorter by water.”

Finally, Becky Bartlett reminds us not to overlook public libraries: “On my annual visit to Sanibel (Florida) I always make the public library one of my first stops. it’s a wonderful place. I get a temp card ($10) and check out all the books I will want while I’m in town. Worth every penny!”
