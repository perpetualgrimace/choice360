We hear it with increasing frequency—at conferences, in focus groups, and during sometimes lively conversations with subscribers: Choice is an ACRL publication, and ACRL supports the transition to a more open system of scholarship. So why isn’t Choice available as an open-access publication? It’s a fair question, and one that deserves some careful analysis before it can be fully answered.

Let’s start with the underlying rationale for the existence of Choice. First and foremost, Choice is a selection tool. Historically, it has existed to fulfill a single function: helping collection-development librarians make informed acquisition choices. Unlike a traditional scholarly journal, Choice does not publish original research or professional development resources; in fact, it is not really a journal at all, it is a *database*, allowing users to filter lists of new publications by various criteria in order to identify those most appropriate for purchase.

Not surprisingly, there are substantial costs associated with this enterprise. Nor has technology reduced the cost structure of publications such as ours. Quite the contrary. Maintenance charges, software licenses, and frequent, necessary investments in upgrades to our editorial and publishing systems layer substantial costs onto already large editorial budgets, particularly in an environment in which we must maintain both print and digital versions of our publication. Arguments that the incremental cost of providing access to digital resources are at or near zero, and that therefore digital content is “free,” miss the point. It is the *total* cost of publication that must be recovered, not merely the “manufacturing” cost.

A little reflection should be sufficient to demonstrate that the standard open-access business models are not good fits for Choice. To start, we have no authors in the traditional sense, or rather, we have hundreds of authors, each contributing a single two-hundred-word review to any given issue. The OA Gold methodology is clearly inappropriate to their work. Perhaps publishers should underwrite Choice. But this would strip the publication of its most valued asset, its reputation for impartiality. ACRL membership dues, then? Hardly, as dues must be allocated against all that the association does for its members, leaving not nearly enough to support our operations. Some form of shared library sponsorship might seem a viable option, provided that enough libraries agree to contribute to the pool, but at what level would that contribution need to be, considering that it must equal or exceed the subscription revenue currently provided by some 2,000 colleges and universities?

Which brings us back to the core function of Choice. Again, Choice is not truly a journal, it is a *tool* used to do work, the important work professional librarians do in selecting monographs for acquisition. Subscribers to Choice are not purchasing “content” as it is commonly understood, they are subscribing to a continuously maintained database that simplifies decision-making and saves time. Asking the users of this tool to defray the cost of producing it does not seem so outlandish to us. That said, we are alert to the tenor of the times and open to alternatives, so let us know what you think. How would *you* recover the cost of publication? (email: tellchoice@ala-choice.org).
