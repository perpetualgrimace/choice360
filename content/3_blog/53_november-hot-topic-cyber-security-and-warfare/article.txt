Bronk, Chris. **Cyber threat: the rise of information geopolitics in U.S. national security.** Praeger, 2016. 232p bibl index afp ISBN 9781440834981, $75.00; ISBN 9781440834998 ebook, contact publisher for price.
*Reviewed in CHOICE September 2016.*

Bronk’s book introduces and assesses new cyber security challenges. Beginning with the premise that the computer and information revolution caused a tremendous geopolitical impact, this slim volume examines how the various and widespread uses of cyberspace affect every aspect of power. Along with frequent changes in cyberspace, shifts in nation-state relations (as well as the increasing importance of non-state actors) have the potential to upend traditional patterns of international and domestic politics. Taking a comprehensive tour through the broad arena of cyber security issues, Bronk examines the rise of cyberspace, the militarization of cyberspace, US cyber defense efforts against vulnerability, the use of the malicious Stuxnet worm, and information security issues. He also delves into the topics of hacker threats to governments and the private sector and other attempts by repressive governments to command control over cyberspace. The arguments within the book are clear and powerful. The reliance on the internet by nation-states, the private sector, and individuals has increased vulnerability for all who depend on cyberspace. How the world adjusts to that reality and how that reality adjusts to the world may be the key dilemmas of the 21st century. **Summing Up:** Recommended. All readers. *—W. W. Newmann, Virginia Commonwealth University*

**China and cybersecurity: espionage, strategy, and politics in the digital domain, **ed. by Jon R. Lindsay, Tai Ming Cheung, and Derek S. Reveron. Oxford, 2015. 375p index afp ISBN 9780190201272, $99.00; ISBN 9780190201272 pbk, $34.95.
*Reviewed in CHOICE November 2015.*

The 13 articles by 18 Canadian, US, and Chinese specialists ponder much but reveal little.  Every form of contestation, from crime to espionage, is instantly modernized with the preface *cyber* (e.g., cyber-reconnaissance).  Constrained by their classified subject matter, the authors outline general parameters.  Basically, everyone hacks everyone else—and knows it but does not say it.  China steals vast amounts of US technology, but imitation may not yield innovation.  The Chinese posit “network warfare” to paralyze the enemy as a main strategy, but it might simply escalate to “kinetic” (boom!) warfare.  In a collection on Chinese cyberpenetration, there is no mention of what the US does.  Washington’s tardy denunciations of Chinese hacks and reluctance to institute serious cybersecurity suggest that the US does plenty and that the present relatively open networks suit the US.  Worms travel in two directions.  The major cyberpowers keep their secrets in reserve; using them too early would alert the adversary to take defensive steps.  China’s cyberwar capacity against “foreign hostile forces” is concentrated in 3/PLA (signals intelligence) but also employs many “cyber militia” units, especially to guard against foreign media penetration, itself a strategic threat.  The volume suggests negotiations with a frightened regime will accomplish little.  **Summing Up:** Recommended. Graduate, research, and professional collections. *—M. G. Roskin, emeritus, Lycoming College*

Corera, Gordon. **Cyberspies: the secret history of surveillance, hacking, and digital espionage.** Pegasus Books, 2016. 431p index ISBN 9781681771540, $29.95.
*Reviewed in CHOICE January 2017. *

Corera (BBC News) shows that code breaking was an important driver in the development of the computer. Paradoxically, he also shows that the development of computer technology has made breaking codes ever more difficult, as encryption has escaped from the hands of governments into the hands of the private sector. At the same time, computer technology has led to the explosion of data, which has made isolating signals from noise ever more difficult for spy agencies. The result is that spy agencies are in a hamster wheel of needing ever higher levels of computer capability to break codes, which makes encryption even easier for enemies. The text is very readable, relying on narratives about individuals who have been important in code breaking, computer development, etc. This reliance is also a weakness because larger issues sometimes get lost. There is also the occasional error in describing or defining important terms, such as *computer virus* or *worm*. Despite these weaknesses, the text is recommended for anyone who wants a general history of code breaking, the development of cyber espionage, and the special relationship that exists between the US and UK in intelligence sharing. ** Summing Up: **Highly recommended. Upper-division undergraduates through professionals. *—K. Buterbaugh, Southern Connecticut State University*

Harris, Shane. **@WAR: the rise of the military-Internet complex.** Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2014. 263p index ISBN 9780544251793, $27.00.
*Reviewed in CHOICE August 2015.*

The bottom line is that the next war will be fought as much in cyberspace as in any other space, maybe even more.  Cyberspace has already become the "fifth domain" of warfare, in addition to land, air, sea, and space. The NSA, CIA, and Pentagon have assembled groups of hackers to launch cyber strikes on enemy targets and have collected huge amounts of information on everybody (enemies and friends).  This practice yields significant successes, such as thwarting attacks on US (and US allies') forces in Iraq.  That is good news.  But journalist/author Harris (senior correspondent, *The Daily Beast*; *The Watchers*, 2010) suggests that government alone cannot cope with the pace of technology, so government agencies have teamed up with technology giants to create a “military-Internet complex."  This is only the beginning.  What is the impact on personal freedom, economic security, and the future of the nation?  Anonymity and collective security are incompatible in cyberspace.  Can citizens trust government alone to balance the two?  According to the author, “the NSA has in many respects made the Internet less safe.”  He concludes that “only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of ... defense with ... peaceful methods and goals" so “security and liberty may prosper together."  **Summing Up:** Recommended. All readership levels.  *—H. Levkowitz, University of Massachusetts*

Poindexter, Dennis F. **The Chinese information war: espionage, cyberwar, communications control and related threats to United States interests.** McFarland, 2013. 192p ISBN 0786472715 pbk, $40.00; ISBN 9780786472710 pbk, $40.00.
*Reviewed in CHOICE November 2013.*

Poindexter, a member of the US intelligence community and a former faculty member at the Defense Security Institute, examines the extent to which various forms of communications control and cyber attacks represent a very real problem for the US. Chapters highlight the ways in which information warfare is consistent with traditional Chinese notions of efficient means of addressing threats and exerting influence and the extent to which the complex interlinks between government and "private industry" in China make this form of insidious threat possible. In many ways, however, the book is more a call to action than an in-depth scholarly analysis of the manner in which Chinese espionage, cyber war, and communications control represent threats to US interests. For example, the author tends to make overly broad assertions, the endnotes are sparse, and many, though not all, of the endnotes are drawn from popular press news articles and/or websites that are not subject to peer review. Despite these very real caveats, the book raises important points and makes a strong case for more coordinated government and private sector efforts to address the information war problem effectively. **Summing Up:** Recommended. General readers, undergraduate students, graduate students, and research faculty. *—C. W. Herrick, Muhlenberg College*

Powers, Shawn M. **The real cyber war: the political economy of Internet freedom,** by Shawn M. Powers and Michael Jablonski. Illinois, 2015. 269p index afp ISBN 9780252039126, $95.00; ISBN 9780252080708 pbk, $25.00; ISBN 9780252097102 ebook, contact publisher for price.
*Reviewed in CHOICE December 2015. *

Powers and Jablonski (both, Georgia State Univ.) take a unique approach to the concept of cyber war, focusing on the very architecture of the Internet itself.  Using the lens of political economy, the authors argue that the “freedom to connect” agenda promoted as a matter of US policy is primarily driven by economic and geopolitical considerations rather than deeper principle.  Though this book is not exhaustive (nor intended to be), it includes case studies of the major players that have built and maintained the architecture of the Internet.  Although the Internet presents a moving target for scholars, Powers and Jablonski do a good job of being as up-to-date as possible and include a final chapter that deals succinctly with Edward Snowden’s revelations about the National Security Agency.  Though the authors deal with sophisticated concepts, they do so in a manner that should be accessible to upper-level undergraduates.  The authors may overreach at times in ascribing motives to US policy, but they make a solid case that it is at least consistent with economic self-interest. **Summing Up:** Recommended. General readers, upper-division undergraduate students, and above. *—T. C. Ellington, Wesleyan College*

Russell, Alison Lawlor. **Cyber blockades.** Georgetown University, 2014. 175p bibl index afp ISBN 9781626161122, $49.95; ISBN 9781626161122 pbk, $29.95; ISBN 9781626161139 ebook, $29.95.
*Reviewed in CHOICE July 2015.*

Russell (Merrimack College) deals with the timely issue of cyber attacks in an accessible way.  She frames cyber blockades within the history of blockade warfare and within the relatively new phenomenon of cyber warfare.  Russell begins by theorizing networks, information, and cyberspace as well as blockades in war and moves on to in-depth explorations of two cyber blockades: Estonia in 2007 and the 2008 Georgia-Russia War.  In the penultimate chapter, the author compares cyber blockades, and in the conclusion, she explores the importance of cyber blockades in understanding state technology matrices and 21st-century war.  The argument is well-made, its assumptions are well-articulated, and the evidence is well-presented.  At the end of the book, though, this reviewer was less than entirely convinced by the argument that it is compelling to study cyber blockades as a type of *either* cyber attack or blockade warfare or even that there is something unique about cyber attacks broadly.  This book, and the field it is in, has more groundwork to lay for that argument.  Still, this book is interesting, timely, and potentially important. **Summing Up:** Highly recommended. Undergraduate students and above. *—L. E. Sjoberg, University of Florida*

Singer, P. W. **Cybersecurity and cyberwar: what everyone needs to know,** by P. W. Singer and Allan Friedman. Oxford, 2014. 306p index afp ISBN 9780199918096, $74.95; ISBN 9780199918119 pbk, $16.95.
*Reviewed in CHOICE May 2015.* 

Singer and Friedman (both, Brookings Institution) have authored a most insightful and readable monograph dealing with all varieties of cyber threats.  A brief concluding chapter follows its three main parts.  Each part features many short subsections covering a diverse set of related topics.  Most subsections include interesting and educational anecdotes, e.g., historical incidents, specific hackers such as Anonymous, or cyber threats such as Stuxnet.  Part 1 focuses on how things associated with the Internet and its security work or evolved or what they are.  The second section details, in part, the different forms of cyber threats, such as crime, espionage, terrorism, and war, and identifies hackers, legal issues, and defenses.  The final part addresses what the government and private industry can do to improve security and provides many other thoughts about handling threats.  An extensive set of reference notes (34 pages) and a glossary support the text.  This book may interest and be appreciated by anyone seeking a better understanding of cyber threats, but it will be especially useful for federal government policy makers and senior corporate executives responsible for company security. **Summing Up:** Recommended. All levels/libraries. *—E. M. Aupperle, University of Michigan*

Springer, Paul J. **Cyber warfare: a reference handbook.** ABC-CLIO, 2015. 340p bibl index afp ISBN 9781610694438, $58.00; ISBN 978-1-61069-444-5 ebook, contact publisher for price.
*Reviewed in Choice September 2015.*

This timely volume, in the publisher's "Reference Handbook" series (which, despite the title, belongs in a library's circulating book collection), offers a narrative of the evolution of military warfare in the context of the Internet.  In the book's first chapters, historian Springer (Air Command and Staff College)—author of scholarly works and other ABC-CLIO volumes, e.g., Military Robots and Drones ((link: http://www.choicereviews.org text: CH, Jul'13, 50-5933 popup:yes))—presents the history of issues concerning cyber attacks, with perspectives (on the escalation of e-Jihad, space as a "cyber asset," etc.) contributed by other authors.  In chapter 4, Springer profiles key individuals and agencies (e.g., the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Google, Inc., NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence, and RAND Corporation, among numerous others).  The final chapters offer a collection of documents central to establishing the boundaries of cyber warfare and an annotated bibliography.  Replete with journalistic accounts, this work chronicles a longitudinal global view of major cyber attacks, including the 2010 WikiLeaks publication of classified government information.  The work addresses controversial issues such as demilitarizing outer space, the challenges of attribution for determining the origin of cyber attacks, cyber ethics, and the importance of proportional retaliation.  **Summing Up: **Recommended. Lower-level undergraduates and above; general readers. *—L. C. Gordon, University of La Verne*

Weimann, Gabriel. **Terrorism in cyberspace: the next generation.** Columbia/Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 2015. 296p bibl index ISBN 9780231704489, $90.00; ISBN 9780231704496 pbk, $30.00; ISBN 9780231801362 ebook, $29.99.
*Reviewed in Choice October 2015.*

Weimann (communication, Univ. of Haifa, Israel) acknowledges that it took 16 years to produce this book.  Given the pace of change in counterterrorism studies, 16 years is a long time.  Though the work is useful as a primer to cyberterrorism, much of it already seems dated.  The author identifies three research questions that will “fill the gap” in readers' understanding of online terrorism.  First, he asks, “What are the new faces of online terrorism?”—and points to Internet services such e-mail, chatrooms, message boards, and *YouTube* as “new” tools in the terrorist toolbox.  Terrorists have moved away from hierarchies in favor of virtual networks.  These are critical observations, but scholars and practitioners have been writing about them for years.  Similarly, the second research question, "What can be expected in the near future?" focuses more on the recent past.  The specter of large-scale, disruptive cyber attacks on networked infrastructure systems is certainly concerning, but governments and industry have already spent billions of dollars defending against that very threat.  Weimann is at his best in the third part, in which he addresses the timeless problem of civil liberties and counterterrorism, significantly increasing his relevance to contemporary readers. **Summing Up: **Recommended. Upper-division undergraduates. *—R. D. Stacey, Saint Constantine College*
