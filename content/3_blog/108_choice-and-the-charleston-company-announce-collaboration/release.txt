Choice and The Charleston Company Announce Collaboration on New Online Review Resource for Academic Databases

Middletown, CT -  Monday, July 11, 2016: Choice and The Charleston Company have announced plans to collaborate on a new reference product, an online review source for academic databases and digital resources, with the working name of CC Advisor. CC Advisor will be published on the database platform recently launched at Choice: www.choice360.org.

The goal is to unveil a working prototype at the Charleston Conference in November and to launch in time for the ACRL conference in Baltimore, March 2017.

Important facts:
•	Editorial efforts will be spearheaded by The Charleston Advisor team.
•	The new product will offer enhanced and updated reviews from The Charleston Advisor archive.
•	New and revised reviews will be added monthly and commissioned especially for the work.
•	Design plans for CC Advisor include a user-friendly interface, extensive search and retrieval functionality, and improved navigation.
•	Updating will be continuous. 
•	An enhanced "competitive analysis" section and an "on the fly" database comparison option will make CC Advisor unique.

"Choice and The Charleston Advisor have long been known for their thoughtful peer reviews," said Choice editor and publisher Mark Cummings. "Teaming up on this new database was a natural progression for us both. CC Advisor will bring a powerful, trustworthy new voice to the evaluation of academic databases."

 “CC Advisor will be what all of us collection developers have been waiting for,” said Katina Strauch, Chair of the Board of The Charleston Advisor and Assistant Dean for Technical Services at the College of Charleston Addlestone Library. “I can’t wait for the launch.”

 "What a wonderful way to mark our 18th year of publication for The Charleston Advisor.  We are very pleased to be working with Choice to bring our reviews to the new CC Advisor platform, which will allow us to keep them up-to-date and accessible to a wider audience of library professionals," said Rebecca Lenzini, president of The Charleston Company.
