While the title might evoke blarney, wedding toasts, and garrulous relatives, this book offers far more than that. In 25 brief chapters, Crystal takes the reader through a complete course in preparing and giving public presentations. This is a charming, intelligent book—this reviewer cannot resist calling it eloquent. It is part instruction and part memoir, with Crystal drawing on his own considerable public-speaking experience to illustrate dos and don’ts. The focus is equally on matters of rhetoric, logistics, and science. Crystal offers tips for thinking through the nature of one’s audience, content, organization, personal style, and pacing to engage listeners. He explains the logistics of speech giving, covering everything from one’s place on the program to sight lines, technology, eye contact, and interruptions from the audience. And he looks at the linguistics and psychology of attention span, sentence weight, the use of pauses and vocal fillers, intonation, and intensity.  The book is filled with rich examples, among them Barack Obama’s 2009 “Yes We Can" speech, which Crystal subjects to an in-depth stylistic analysis. This reviewer learned something from every chapter. This thought-provoking book will be invaluable to those who engage in public speaking.

**Summing Up: Essential. All readers.**
