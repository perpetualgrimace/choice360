At the first signs of spring it is easy to forget the hard sledding through the winter months. Even though the weather here this past winter was milder than in many previous years, the climate *indoors* was bracing. With the retirement of our editorial director, the arrival of several new staff members, and the ongoing rebuilding of our products and services, the demands on the staff have been extraordinary, and although many people contributed to these efforts, I would like to single out for special thanks two staffers who made a difference here at Choice this past winter: Lisa Mitten, one of our social sciences editors, and Becky Bartlett, humanities editor.

Lisa has been an academic librarian since 1984, first as a cataloger at Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord, NH, next as the anthropology bibliographer at the University of Pittsburgh for fourteen years, and “lately,” for the past fifteen years, an editor at Choice. A longtime active member and a past president of the American Indian Library Association (AILA), Lisa created AILA’s first website as well as one of the (link: http://www.nativeculturelinks.com/indians.html text: first compilations on the Internet for Native American websites). She is a coeditor of Native America in the Twentieth Century: An Encyclopedia (1996) and was the subject editor for the Native American Studies section of Resources for College Libraries 2006–2015. Lisa is a native of Pittsburgh, where she visits her daughter and granddaughter as often as she can.

Becky began her career in publishing at McCall’s and then at Esquire, in its heyday, as coordinating editor and later copyeditor. In 1978 she moved to New Haven and continued to work as an occasional freelancer—writing, editing, graphic design—while raising two children and (from 1991 to 1993) commuting to Boston to earn an MLS at Simmons, joining Choice shortly after graduation. In her twenty-three years at Choice she has edited some 35,000 (thousand!) reviews, commissioned and edited numerous bibliographic essays, written editorials, and represented Choice at dozens of conferences. In her spare time she edited three special collections: Choice’s Outstanding Academic Books, 1992–1997; Choice’s Outstanding Academic titles, 1998–2002; and Choice’s Outstanding Academic Titles, 2007–2011. Recently she has been the unofficial liaison between our editorial and production groups and has worked with our operations manager developing editorial content for new products.

Both of these fine editors possess that most invaluable of qualities: the ability to rise to the occasion under difficult circumstances. Some of it is born of experience, out of a hard-won knowledge that problems are rarely as insurmountable as we imagine them to be, but the balance is the product of character, of wanting to make things better for the people around them. That part cannot be taught, and those of us who work with such people are the beneficiaries of more than simply their hard work. Thanks are due, then, to Lisa and to Becky both, for all the things they bring to Choice.
