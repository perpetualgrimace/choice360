In a time of transition, and on the eve of some exciting changes at Choice, I am very pleased to announce the appointment of two new members of our editorial staff, *Bill Mickey*, our new editorial director, and *John Stoehr*, the second of our two editors in the social sciences.

Bill brings to his position a substantial knowledge of information technologies and the digital marketplace—skills that will be invaluable as we refine our own publishing strategies—and extensive experience as a director of editorial operations. Until recently, he served as editorial director of Folio: magazine at Red 7 Media, a division of Access Intelligence. Bill joined Red 7 Media in 2004 and held a variety of positions within its publishing group, including senior editor for Folio: and executive editor of Expo magazine. Prior to joining Red 7, Bill was editor of EContent, where he was instrumental in relaunching the 30-year-old magazine covering the digital content market. Before that, he served as editor of Online magazine, a trade publication serving information professionals and corporate and academic librarians who use online database and digital information products. The combination of Bill’s experience in digital media and our own deep understanding of the information needs of academic libraries should yield exciting new opportunities for Choice-branded products.

John Stoehr assumed the position of social sciences editor responsible for political science, law, business, and economics in March. An accomplished journalist, John has served as managing editor of The Washington Spectator, a national bulletin of politics and public affairs, and has written for Newsweek, Salon, CNN, Reuters, and Columbia Journalism Review, among many others. He has taught journalism, government, and politics at Yale, Wesleyan, and the University of New Haven and is currently a fellow at the Yale Journalism Initiative and an associate fellow of Yale’s Ezra Stiles College, where he is a lecturer in political science. Between 2005 and 2007, he was selected three times for fellowships in the NEA’s Arts Journalism Institute and in 2009 received one of the Lilly Scholarships in Religion for Journalists.

The work of the best editors always remains hidden. When editors do their work well, even their authors are unaware of what has been done with their texts, believing they made them so themselves. (Yes, that is a paraphrase. A year’s free subscription to Choice to the first person who (email: tellchoice@ala-choice.org text: identifies the source text!)) But in this case I believe you *will* begin to see the results of their work, not so much in Choice, the publication, but in the ways that Choice, the publishing unit, communicates with our subscribers, listens to your concerns, and provides products and services that help you do your work better. We here at Choice are delighted to have these two accomplished editors join our staff and hope that you will join us in welcoming Bill and John as we continue to expand the reach and utility of Choice to the academic library community.
