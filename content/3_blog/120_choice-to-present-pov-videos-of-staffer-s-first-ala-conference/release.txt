Middletown, CT – January 18, 2017: Choice digital media coordinator Mark Derks will chronicle his first attendance at an ALA conference, the 2017 ALA Midwinter Meeting, later this month in a series of video clips to be posted via the Choice Media Channel on YouTube. These Point of View video clips will be noted with #ALAMW17POV.

Founded over fifty years ago, Choice has long been known for bringing reliable review coverage and bibliographic essays to the academic library community. Recently, in the interest of providing new tools for the changing needs of today's librarians, it has launched products including the all-new Choice Reviews database, open access LibGuides, and a popular free webinar series. Now, Choice will present a fresh perspective on conference-going, with staffer Derks documenting his ALA Midwinter Meeting experiences in a POV video diary.

"I’m excited (and a little nervous) to record my first ALA Midwinter Meeting and share it with everyone who visits our YouTube channel," said Mark Derks. "There are so many people I’m looking forward to meeting and speaking with at the conference. It’ll be cool to bring a little of that to people’s phones and screens—sort of a taste of Midwinter for those who have been #ALAleftbehind."

Links to the video clips will go out via postings on the Choice Facebook and Twitter account, and will be housed on the Choice Media Channel. The hashtag #ALAMW17POV will be used to mark the videos, and Choice invites other attendees to similarly share their conference experience video clips.
