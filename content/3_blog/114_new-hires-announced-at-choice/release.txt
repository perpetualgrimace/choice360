### Choice Announces Two New Hires - Subject Editor Melissa Ceraso and Senior Web Developer Jason Simon

Middletown, CT – August 22, 2016: Melissa Ceraso has been named editor in mathematics and the natural sciences, and Jason Simon has been named senior web developer for Choice, effective immediately. Choice (http://choice360.org), a publishing unit of the Association of College and Research Libraries, a division of the American Library Association, is the publisher of Choice, the premier source for reviews of new English-language books and digital resources for academic libraries.

Until recently, Melissa Ceraso was the Evergreen Systems Manager at Bibliomation, Inc., the largest library consortium in the state of Connecticut. There, she managed and maintained Evergreen, an open-source integrated library system utilized throughout the entire consortium. During her tenure at Bibliomation, she fulfilled the role of lead project manager for the new union catalog and the new interlibrary loan system for the Connecticut State Library. In addition, she was the project manager for Bibliomation’s library migration projects. Prior to her employment at Bibliomation, Melissa worked in multiple library settings – ranging from providing reference services for a document delivery company to cataloging government documents for an academic library. Melissa holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from the University of Connecticut and a Master of Library Science degree from Southern Connecticut State University. In her mathematics and natural sciences editorial role at Choice, where she succeeds Georgia Scura and Cynthia Crooker, she will report to Bill Mickey, editorial director.

Holding a master’s degree in library and information science from Simmons, Jason Simon spent the past five-and-a-half years serving as the technology & serials librarian at Fitchburg State University, where he was responsible for creating  a custom electronic resources management (ERM) system and a system for digitizing open-access periodicals.  A designer of websites since the mid-1990s, he has presented and published on developing small digital management systems, electronic asset management, and usability and brings to Choice expertise in database design, information literacy, and web development.  Prior to earning his MLIS, Jason did graduate work in sociology at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. In his role at Choice, the first of its kind at the publishing unit, Jason will work closely with developers to create the upcoming CC Advisor product and to upgrade Choice Reviews, and will play a major role in modifications and improvements to Choice's back-end systems. He will report to Mark Cummings, editor and publisher.

“We are thrilled to welcome Melissa and Jason to the Choice team,” said Cummings. "With Melissa on board, we have a hearty roster of subject editors, and are excited about her editorial skills as well as knowledge of the modern academic library landscape. In a role new to Choice, Jason brings a wealth of knowledge about library systems as well as web development expertise. It's a time of real growth and innovation at Choice, and these two new hires exemplify the direction in which we are headed."
