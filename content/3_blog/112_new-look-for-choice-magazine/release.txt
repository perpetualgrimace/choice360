###  New Look for Choice Magazine Debuts with Sept. 2016 Issue

####  	Middletown, CT –  August 11 , 2016:  With the September 2016 issue, Choice will unveil a new cover and interior design, the first such change at the magazine in almost a decade. The premier source for reviews of academic books, digital media and Internet resources in higher education for over fifty years, Choice is a publication of the Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL), a division of the American Library Association. 
#### 	Launched in 1964 out of office space at Wesleyan University’s Olin Library under the leadership of founding editor Richard K. Gardner, Choice magazine originated as “a monthly current book selection guide to aid colleges and junior colleges in strengthening their library collections with the best of academic materials.”  Since then, Choice has expanded coverage to accommodate new subjects and formats of interest to the academic community, most notably the proliferation of  new digital and Internet resources.  Choice's contributions to the academic library community have grown in recent years beyond reviews, with highlights such as bibliographic essays, the Outstanding Academic Titles list, forthcoming titles lists, and most recently, features devoted to community college libraries, including the editors' top 75 community college resources list.
#### 	The new cover design of Choice reflects an overall rebranding effort begun earlier this year, which includes a new logo and tagline for the Choice publishing unit. 
#### 	"There have been a number of changes recently at Choice, with several new staffers in place, the launch of the Choice Reviews database this summer, the redesigned and expanded Choice360.org site, and new products on the horizon. We are committed to providing academic librarians with the support and tools they need to do their jobs in today's changing world of information," said Mark Cummings, Choice editor and publisher. "It's an exciting time for us and one that called for a fresh look all around. We are especially proud of the new cover and interior design of Choice.  Rest assured, though, that beautiful photographs of academic libraries will still take center stage on our covers moving forward."
