Campbell (SUNY Buffalo) has written a well-researched, highly provocative volume on American political polarization, which challenges a great deal of conventional wisdom on the subject. Campbell believes that both the electorate and the two major political parties have become more politically polarized since the 1960s, that the process has occurred in both political parties (the Democrats moved left before the Republicans moved right), that polarization has been a grassroots movement, and that a period of party de-alignment was followed by one in which the two parties more clearly divided themselves into rival ideological camps. Moreover, as parties have relied increasingly on supporters on the right and the left, the threat that such voters will stay home has limited parties' ability to move to the center. Polarization, which centers largely on differing views about the role of government, has replaced pluralism as the dominant political reality. Many proposed political reforms are misguided because reformers do not understand the magnitude of current polarization. Although this increased political polarization makes governing more difficult, basic rules of civility and a more tolerant approach toward compromise can help.

**Summing Up: Essential. All readership levels.**
