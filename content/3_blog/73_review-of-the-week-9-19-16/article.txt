**Rock 'n' film : cinema's dance with popular music**

Covering rock 'n' roll filmmaking in its entirety, this accomplished volume is readily accessible and written (as James himself notes) without the jargon that often mars film studies.  James (USC) begins in the 1950s, with such films as Blackboard Jungle and Rock around the Clock, and then moves smoothly through the cinematic offerings of Elvis Presley and the Beatles, D. A. Pennebaker’s landmark Monterrey Pop (1968), and the work of independent filmmaker Kenneth Anger, whose rock 'n' roll biker movie Scorpio Rising (1964) remains one the most influential films in this area.  The book explodes with fresh insights on a vast number of films—among them Head, starring the Monkees; The T.A.M.I. Show, perhaps the greatest rock 'n' roll documentary ever made–and even manages to fit in Jean-Luc Godard’s One Plus One (aka Sympathy for the Devil) and Robert Frank’s iconoclastic documentary on The Rolling Stones.  Illustrated with a host of frame blowups, this informed, sharp, inviting, and absolutely authoritative book will be the source to beat on the subject of rock 'n' roll movies for quite some time.

**Summing Up: **Essential. All readers.
