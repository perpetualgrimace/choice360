*Middletown, CT – December 21, 2015:*

Choice, the premier review journal for new English-language books and digital resources for academic libraries, has launched a new section on its revamped www.choice360.org site, featuring Choice bibliographic essays in LibGuide format.

At launch, the LibGuide section will contain all eleven of the bibliographic essays published in 2015, with essays from 2013 and 2014 to be added in the spring. Moving forward, new bibliographic essays will be featured simultaneously in the LibGuide format as well as in Choice magazine and on Choice Reviews Online.

“LibGuides have become increasingly popular with librarians, so presenting the Choice bibliographic essays in such a useful format was a natural progression for us,” said Mark Cummings, editor and publisher of Choice. “And publishing our essays as open-access content makes them readily accessible as research tools for students and faculty, one of the ways in which we are working to expand the reach and utility of Choice.”
Also new to Choice360.org are dedicated sections on the new Choice tablet app, Outstanding Academic Titles (OATs), and ACRL books and digital resources.
