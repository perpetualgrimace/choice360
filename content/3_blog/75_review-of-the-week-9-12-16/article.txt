When the reviewer received this book, the first thought that came to mind was, “Who is John Vassos?” The name sounded familiar yet could not be identified. The reviewer’s guilt over not recognizing the name grew as he worked through the book—not only because he recognized much of Vassos’s work but also because this particular innovator defined a significant portion of American design in the mid-20th century. This book is not simply the first biography of a designer who was a major contributor to the design of consumer electronics but also a solid examination of the evolution of consumer and industrial design during Vassos’s lifetime. Overall, the most telling element is the book’s discussion of why John Vassos did not enter the pantheon of design: his work was not about the iconic but truly about what actually functioned. Vassos’s goal was to transform new technologies into entities that were intuitive and easy to use, as well as reassure consumers that these were items that fit and belonged in their homes. As such, his design fit the standard of “ideal design”—it was design so good that one could forget it was ever designed.
