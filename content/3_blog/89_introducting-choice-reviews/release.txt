INTRODUCING CHOICE REVIEWS!

Middletown, CT -  June 1, 2016:  Choice has announced the launch of a new service called Choice Reviews, a completely redesigned Choice Reviews Online built to respond directly to the many suggestions received from subscribers.  This version has been engineered to work the way that librarians do, with an intuitive user interface, improved search and discovery features, and data management tools that will save you time and simplify decision-making. The new Choice Reviews features advanced technology that makes librarians faster and better at what they have been doing for centuries: identifying the best sources. 

With tools that make it easy to save, share, and manage results, Choice Reviews puts the power of curation back into the hands of librarians.

•	Searchable database of almost 200,000 academic reviews
•	Intuitive interface to make searches faster and easier
•	Reviews published in real time for immediate access
•	Build lists, save searches, create alerts, find books in WorldCat, poll faculty on their 	preferences, and even add titles to your GOBI shopping cart

Choice Reviews is designed to be used by librarians, faculty, and patrons—as a source of bibliographic information and critical reviews of works being considered for research projects and/or classroom assignments.
