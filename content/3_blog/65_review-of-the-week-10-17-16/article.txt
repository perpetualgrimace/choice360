Just as tragedies demonstrate transcendent achievements in the face of death, so do circus performers demonstrate what skilled humans can achieve often against dangerous obstacles.  Similarly, as comedies demonstrate human frailties in the face of life-affirming conclusions, circus clowns demonstrate how people stumble even as they persevere.  The history of what we call circus goes back to ancient times.  Simon (emer., Skidmore College) has achieved a great deal in this book.  Often relating circuses to the ways they have been represented in art, she offers detailed descriptions of the basic elements of circus acts.  After a fine introduction covering circus history, she devotes chapters to the elements that make up circus performance.  She addresses the conflict that emerged in the 19th century between one-ring circuses and circuses that had three rings of simultaneous performers.  Sadly, there is no mention of the role the subsidized Soviet circus had in refining circus art and developing training methods that have been emulated throughout the world.  This notwithstanding, this beautifully produced book—with its excellent color reproductions, extensive notes, and useful bibliography—is a must for those interested in popular culture.

**Summing Up:** Essential. Lower-division undergraduates, vo-tech students, graduate students, professionals, general readers.
