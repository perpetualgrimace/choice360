As regular readers of this column know, we at Choice are in the midst of a major effort to extend the reach and value of the services we provide, and so at the dawn of the new year I thought I’d take a moment to review briefly our work over the past twelve months.

Easily the most exciting development of the year, at least in terms of new technology, was the launch of the Choice tablet app. As I mentioned in an earlier editorial, the app is designed to bridge the gap between the journal format of our print magazine and the database capabilities of Choice Reviews Online. Equally important, it is a useful laboratory both for experimenting with new content types and for presenting our traditional materials in an attractive, easy-to-search format. The tablet has also proved to be a professional-development platform, allowing users access to the entire archive of Choice/ACRL webinars. If you have not downloaded the app (it’s free to subscribers), now would not be too soon!

Hand in hand with publication of the tablet app came two changes in Choice editorial content. Following on the creation, in 2014, of articles on special collections (Ask an Archivist) and the institution of a standing series of guest editorials, this past year we partnered with the ACI Information Group to include in the app a live stream from the ACI Scholarly Blog Index, an editorially created and curated index of scholarly social media. Beginning this month we offer coverage in five subjects areas: political science, business and economics, history, the natural sciences, and library blogs, providing users access to what ACI notes is “a 360-degree view of an author’s work by connecting traditional publications with scholarly blog posts and social media.”

The other change is the mounting of our bibliographic essays on the LibGuides platform, available from within the app and on Choice360.org. Among the many virtues of this format is the link it provides to WorldCat, improving the utility of the essays by enabling users to rapidly locate sources cited in run of text. Our plan is to have a five-year archive of these essays available as LibGuides by early spring.

Community colleges were another editorial focus during 2015, with the addition of a dedicated section listing significant new titles for community colleges and the graphic indication of all titles appropriate for community college libraries in the reviews themselves. Together, these two features, which appear in all three versions of Choice, will make identification of appropriate titles much faster and easier.

Finally, no account of our year would be complete without mention of the success of the Choice/ACRL webinar program, which expanded to 30 presentations and attracted over 5,400 (!) attendees. The full library of these free webinars, some 55 screenings overall, may be found on our YouTube channel, Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries, arranged into thematic playlists for easy discovery.

The year to come will see the introduction of more major changes at Choice, and I’m looking forward to introducing them to you in a future editorial. For the moment, however, we are happy simply to take a deep breath and look back with pride on the work we have done.
