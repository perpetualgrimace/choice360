This work befits Leonhard Euler, one of the greatest mathematicians ever, and fills in details that raise his stature even further.  As a historian, Calinger (emer., Catholic Univ. of America) is respected for his texts that explore the history of mathematics.  This focused effort is his best!  Calinger successfully embeds Euler’s mathematical and physics results in a rich context—cultural, political, religious, and intellectual—while providing great insight into Euler as a person.  Though Calinger does mention many of Euler’s amazing mathematical creations—theorems, concepts, symbols, and entirely new fields—he does not focus on explaining the details.  Rather, he rightfully maintains his focus on Euler as a mathematician in a context.  In turn, Calinger’s documentation of revealed events and responding actions is impressive.  To explore Euler’s mathematical results in more detail, readers should consult the excellent tercentenary volumes issued by the Mathematical Association of America in 2007, e.g., Euler at 300, edited by R. Bradley, L. D'Antonio, and C. Sandifer (CH, Feb'08, 45-3165).  In addition to mathematics, Calinger includes Euler’s contributions in areas such as optics, fluid mechanics, telescopes, ballistics, cartography, and music theory.  Extensive chapter notes, an impressive bibliography, a helpful principal name index, and a general index support the work.  Read this book about Euler and be enlightened!
