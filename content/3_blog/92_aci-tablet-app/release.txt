*Middletown, CT – October 27, 2015:*

*Choice*, the premier review journal for new English-language books and digital resources for academic libraries, and ACI Information Group have teamed up to share select content from the ACI Scholarly Blog Index on Choice’s new tablet app.

Founded in 2004 as Newstex, (link: http://www.aci.info text: ACI Information Group) today is the world’s leading aggregator of editorially selected and curated social media publications. The ACI Scholarly Blog Index is a collection of more than one million scholarly blog articles written by academics, researchers, and industry experts, with each blog article accompanied by a detailed author profile showing education, current position, awards and prizes, and social connections—all of which provide librarians with an authoritative social media resource of commentary, insights, and opinions.

Launched on the Choice tablet app’s October 2015 issue, a selection of blogs in specific subject areas from the ACI Scholarly Blog Index will be featured each month; for example, the October tablet app included a listing of blogs in the health sciences, and the November tablet app includes a listing of business and economics blogs.
“We are excited about partnering with ACI Information Group to introduce Choice tablet app readers to their content, and we’re off to a great start,” said Mark Cummings, editor and publisher of Choice. “Choice is committed to bringing a variety of content, tools, and perspectives to the academic library community, and this is just one of the new ways in which we are meeting that commitment.”

The December 2015 issue of the Choice tablet app will see the Scholarly Blog Index feature grow to streaming content of over twenty-five blogs across more than five subject areas, including library science, as selected by ACI and Choice.
