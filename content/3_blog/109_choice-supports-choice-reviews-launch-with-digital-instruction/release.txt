**Choice Supports Its Recent Choice Reviews Launch with Digital Instruction**

 Middletown, CT – July 12, 2016: In June, Choice announced the launch of Choice Reviews, a completely redesigned version of its digital database, built to respond directly to the many suggestions received from subscribers. The new Choice Reviews ((link: http:// text: www.choicereviews.org)) features advanced technology that makes librarians faster and better at what they have been doing for centuries: identifying the best sources. In order to introduce newcomers to the database and make the transition from the previous version seamless for current users, Choice is providing the following instructional vehicles:

•	A series of four 2-3 minute video tutorials, each focusing on a specific aspect of the Choice Reviews user experience, have been published on the Choice Media Channel:
Tutorial 1: Getting Started (link: http:// text: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cP_tNEQ60E))
Tutorial 2: Searching and Browsing (link: http:// text: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIp5r1t3dvE)
Tutorial 3: Lists, Saved Searches, and Alerts (link: http:// text: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_HZ93MpCOM)
Tutorial 4: Poll Your Colleagues Using Card Stacks (link: http:// text: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM7SnUVwOZg)

•	A free, live webinar will be presented on Thursday, July 14, 2p.m. Eastern, entitled "Starting with Better Options: How to Make the Most of Choice Reviews." This session is an introduction to the features and benefits of the new Choice Reviews by one of its architects, Choice editor and publisher Mark Cummings. Valuable for current subscribers as well as those new to the product, the session will focus on Choice Reviews’ basic functions and will allow participants to ask questions. To register for the webinar, click here (link: http:// text: http://acrlchoice.learningtimesevents.org/webinar-july142016/). An archived version of this webinar will be available on the Choice Media Channel on July 15.
