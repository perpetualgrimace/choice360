Sociologist Rivera (Northwestern Univ.) has written an exceptionally useful study of how hiring for elite starting jobs is actually done in the US.  This insider study shows how the top investment banks, law firms, and consulting companies hire only from a double handful of leading universities, law schools, and business schools.  At each step of the selection process, qualities that favor students with the most privileged backgrounds are the very qualities that help them get hired.  Those doing the hiring, unsurprisingly, tend to have these qualities themselves. When they select for “fit” with the firm, “polish," and “drive," they tend to reproduce the elite level of the class structure.  Yet the hiring committees believe they are simply hiring the “best individuals,” without favoring any particular background.  In her book, Rivera explicates what Bourdieu’s idea of elite cultural capital means in an American context today.  She also shows that most students at these schools succumb to the pressure to apply for this very tiny pool of jobs and firms, a process in which the schools themselves are full partners.  This significant sociological study will also likely be read as a how-to manual.
