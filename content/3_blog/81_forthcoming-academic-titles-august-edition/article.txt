This annual feature highlights print works related to the internet scheduled for publication from August 2016 to early 2017. Titles include introductory guides as well as more specialized manuals, books related to incorporating the internet into business and educational activities, works focusing on social influences and policy aspects, and books on legal issues and cyber security.  As with others in *Choice*'s popular Forthcoming series, this selected list is designed to provide information about publications that may support academic curricula, particularly at the undergraduate level, and to assist librarians and faculty responsible for selection and collection development.

Titles are organized into six broad subject categories: Internet and Business; Internet and Education; Internet and Librarianship; Internet and Security; Internet and Society; and Research and Technical Guides. 

In compiling this list, *Choice* invited publishers to submit title information for 2016 and 2017 publications. The bibliographic information was supplied directly by publishers or obtained from publisher catalogs and promotional materials; data include anticipated release date, price, and ISBN. Estimated prices and dates are followed by "e."  As in all lists of this type, release dates, prices, and even titles are subject to change.

*Choice* extends special thanks to the publishers who supplied and verified information about their new and forthcoming titles for this feature. (This list originally appears in the August issue of *Choice* magazine.)
