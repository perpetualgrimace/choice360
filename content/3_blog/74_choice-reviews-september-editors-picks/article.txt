Feltus, William J. **Inside campaigns: elections through the eyes of political professionals,** by William J. Feltus, Kenneth M. Goldstein, and Matthew Dallek. SAGE Publishing, 2016. 304p index afp ISBN 9781506332963 pbk, $39.00.
 
Inside Campaigns takes readers into the world of campaign managers. Powered by scores of interviews and surveys of political professionals, the book considers the purpose, potency, and poetry of modern political campaigns in the US. Written by a team with both a scholarly pedigree and a hand in applied politics, Inside Campaigns is a deeper, more systematic approach than seen in several other volumes that do little more than transcribe the comments of political professionals. Instead, the authors take readers on a carefully laid out guided tour of major campaign tasks, such as voter targeting and message strategy. Though the typical campaign text is stuffed with data and wrung free of life, Inside Campaigns includes the drama and intrigue that courses through the topic. Run the negative ad or not? Put money into a field staff, or shift resources elsewhere? These are decisions that can elect candidates and determine whether campaign professionals will work again. An invaluable guide for college students considering a career in campaign politics and a useful work for any campaigns class. **Summing Up:** Essential. Lower-division undergraduates through professionals. *--Niven, David*

Ginsberg, Benjamin. **Presidential government**. Yale, 2016. 492p bibl index afp ISBN 9780300212068 pbk, $45.00.

Ginsberg’s new work is destined to become the quintessential textbook on the American presidency. Ginsberg (Johns Hopkins Univ.) moves away from the traditional focus on leadership styles and personality traits presidential scholars employed in the last half of the 20th century to study the chief executive. Instead, he examines the presidency through a “historical-institutional” approach that emphasizes both history and institutions as keys to understanding the growth of presidential power. Ginsberg argues that the Constitution puts Congress at an institutional disadvantage, and that ambitious and talented chief executives have used this advantage to expand the powers of the presidency. Ginsberg remains true to his approach and skillfully interweaves it through each chapter of the text. The work is well documented and includes both classical and cutting-edge presidential scholarship. Ginsberg includes an interesting collection of vignettes about the presidency that he titles "Photo Essays." The fascinating content of these vignettes includes such topics as first spouses and presidential eligibility. In conclusion, this work provides the presidential scholar and student with a comprehensive, cogent, intelligent, and up-to-date examination of the American presidency. **Summing Up:** Essential. Lower-division undergraduates through faculty. *--Hedtke, James Richard*

**Latina/o college student leadership: emerging theory, promising practice**, ed. by Adele Lozano. Lexington Books, 2015. 212p bibl index afp ISBN 9781498520225, $95.00; ISBN 9781498520232 ebook, $94.99.

Lozano (Univ. of Wisconsin—La Crosse) has accomplished her goal of opening the door to a greater understanding of Latina/o students in higher education. After reading her text, readers will have a new understanding of how to support and promote student success. The contributors need to be applauded because this book is the first of its kind to address Latino students in higher education within the context of leadership development. Strengths of this book are many. The application of theoretical perspectives, frameworks, and models of leadership development throughout the entire book is remarkable. The research methods used with the different readings should serve as ideal types—qualitative, quantitative, testimonia, narratives, and participatory action research were used throughout the book as well! The use of a variety of terms to describe the population and the deliberate avoidance of a standardized definition of leader or leadership strengthens the book. Other jewels include various recommendations and uncommon insights. For instance, understanding Villalobos’s notion of followership and including the experiences of undocumented students is a must. This book is a must read for all in higher education. **Summing Up:** Highly recommended. All readership levels. *-- Wall, Amitra A.*

Maoz, Dan. **Astrophysics in a nutshell**. 2nd ed. Princeton, 2016. 290p index afp ISBN 9780691164793, $85.00; ISBN 9781400881178 ebook, contact publisher for price.

The first edition of Astrophysics in a Nutshell (link: http://www.choicereviews.org/ text: (CH, Oct'07, 45-0850)) was exceptional. The subject topics included material required for furthering advanced study—e.g., stellar observations, evolution, galactic structure, and observational and theoretical cosmology. The updated version retains the same features and material, with additional fresh topics. What makes this book special is the manner in which the author interweaves the concepts, often subtle and complex, with enough mathematical support to create persuasive conclusions. During the reading process, the student is encouraged to analyze the use of back-of-the-envelope reasoning and calculations. The limits of such procedures are made clear and are combined with suggestions for refining the arguments, when needed. A new chapter on extrasolar planets reflects the renewed interest in and great success of discovering candidates and confirming their existence. Many special observational techniques are treated in detail. The chapters on cosmology feature new material (through 2014) on tests and probes. The book is outstanding and belongs on all physics professors’ desks and in all colleges and libraries. **Summing Up:** Highly recommended. Upper-division undergraduates through professionals and practitioners. *-- Schick, Kenneth L.*

Redman, Samuel J. **Bone rooms: from scientific racism to human prehistory in museums**. Harvard, 2016. 373p index afp ISBN 9780674660410, $29.95.

Over the past few generations, museum professionals and academics in museum studies have grappled with the fact that museums from the late-18th through the mid-20th centuries exhibited humans as a species through the lens of racial hierarchies, which contemporary science regards as utterly unfounded and truly recognizes as institutionalized pseudo-scientific racism. Though scholars are moving in the right direction at cleaning up the museums, they are not at the finish line yet. In this remarkably powerful work, which everyone in the museum field should read and that will certainly have a much wider audience, Redman (history, Univ. of Massachusetts) reveals the history of how systemic institutionalized racism that utilized human remains as core content for exhibitions, as well as the storerooms, evolved. In addition to the overall content, one feature that makes this a landmark work is that the author never relies on broad generalizations. Rather, he brings to life details and historical actors and sifts through the complexity, enabling an easily understood story to emerge. This is much more than an institutional history. **Summing Up:** Essential. All public and academic levels/libraries. *-- Maxwell-Long, Thomas*

Ross, Lawrence. **Blackballed: the black and white politics of race on America's campuses**. St. Martin's, 2016. 266p index afp ISBN 9781250079114, $25.99; ISBN 9781466891746 ebook, contact publisher for price.

Ross delivers a very timely and important book that documents both the historical and current racial climates on college campuses in the US. Each chapter provides a multitude of examples of how racism permeates colleges and universities, resulting in hostile campus climates. The examples Ross uses to illustrate the insidious and pervasive nature of racism in higher education are compelling and taken from very recent history, pulled from current headlines as recently as the SAE incident at the University of Oklahoma in 2015. Ross reveals the racism that exists in both the curricular and co-curricular venues on college campuses, resulting in a lack of safety for African American students enrolled in predominantly white institutions. He expertly shows the many ways that racism is infused into the structure of higher education institutions, including the naming of buildings, anti-affirmative action policies, and long-held campus traditions. Ross leaves readers with an appeal for proactive versus reactive measures—mandates that all institutions should employ immediately. Required reading for anyone involved, interested, and invested in the education of all students. **Summing Up:** Essential. All public and academic levels/libraries. *-- Hodes, Jacqueline S.*

**The SAGE encyclopedia of cancer and society**, ed. by Graham A. Colditz. 2nd ed. SAGE Publications, 2015. 3v bibl index afp ISBN 9781483345734, $495.00; ISBN 9781483345741 ebook, contact publisher for price.

In this updated edition of the three-volume encyclopedia edited by Colditz (Washington Univ. School of Medicine), about 90 percent of the approximately 600 signed entries contributed by nearly 200 scholars are completely new, compared to the first edition published in 2007 (link: http://www.choicereviews.org/ text: (CH, Mar'08, 45-3533)). The work provides background information and a chronological time line of the development of fundamental cancer research and treatment; it also offers an integrated global-health perspective on cancer prevention and survivorship. Contributors examine types of cancer treatment and therapy—from biological therapy and chemotherapy to surgery and alternative treatments—and also the prevention effects of existing medicines such as aspirin and vitamins, along with discussion of the action of well-known and suspected carcinogens.

Notably, this work is not solely devoted to adult-onset cancers but covers childhood cancers as well. In addition to entries on the world's major cancer treatment centers and hospitals, the set covers pharmaceutical companies and laboratories, providing the context for understanding the roles not only of caregivers and others in society but also of industry itself in dealing with and contributing to the risks and burden of cancer. As a reference work, the set is unique in its scope, providing information about cancer epidemiology and incident rates in different regions of the world, drawn from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and from associations in countries outside the US. The "Cancer Statistics Review, 1975-2011" appendix offers more than 100 pages of summary data from the National Cancer Institute's (link:  http://seer.cancer.gov/ text: SEER) (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) Program. The new information contained in this second edition justifies replacing the first. **Summing Up:** Highly recommended. All libraries. All levels.* --Jeong, Sarah H.*

Sauer, Michelle M. **Gender in medieval culture**. Bloomsbury, 2015. 207p bibl index ISBN 9781441142627 pbk, $32.95; ISBN 9781441186942 ebook, contact publisher for price.

Sauer (English, Univ. of North Dakota) provides a detailed overview of important scholarship on medieval and gender studies over the past 30 years. Her engaging account explores the wide range of the Middle Ages in terms of society’s understanding of gender and gendered roles, transgression, religion, and power. This time period is as complex as any, with double standards depending on social status and knowledge. People of the time relied heavily on Roman and Greek ideals for law, medicine, and science, as well as on Christianity. Key to this text is the idea that medical knowledge at the time informed people’s beliefs that men and women were literally the same body, but women were an imperfect replica. Easy to read and useful to researchers and students alike, this book is ideal for all college levels and would serve as a good introduction to gender in the medieval time period. **Summing Up:** Highly recommended. All levels/libraries. *-- Martinez, Michelle*

Stigler, Stephen M. **The seven pillars of statistical wisdom**. Harvard, 2016. 230p bibl index afp ISBN 9780674088917 pbk, $22.95.

Stigler (Univ. of Chicago) did not simply write a book about the fundamental, underlying methods used in statistics; he tells a beautifully crafted story of the history of those methods.  This is a seamless little work, and both novices and experts will learn much more than they probably expected and be wonderfully entertained in the process.  The book contains seven chapters: "Aggregation," "Information," "Likelihood," "Intercomparison," "Regression," "Design," and "Residual."  Stigler gives the "when" and the "why" each approach was introduced as well as a wealth of historical biographic information and actual period data.  This is really a history of ideas told by a master storyteller.  The author breathes life into the subject and draws readers in with wit and humor, something often missing in the writings of others on the subject.  By the end of this book, readers will wish for more.  They should take heart though—two other books by Stigler, Statistics on the Table: The History of Statistical Concepts and Methods (link: http://www.choicereviews.org/ text: CH, Mar'00, 37-3952)) and The History of Statistics: The Measurement of Uncertainty before 1900 (1986) fill that void. **Summing Up:** Highly recommended. All levels/libraries. *-- Pour, Robert L.*

Tsang, Eileen Yuk-Ha. **Understanding Chinese society: changes and transformations**. World Scientific, 2016. 172p bibl index afp (Series on contemporary China, 37) ISBN 9789814644853, $106.00; ISBN 9789814644877 ebook, $85.00.

This is an immensely readable overview of life in present-day urban China.  Sociologist Tsang (City Univ. of Hong Kong) has put together an informative account of some of the emergent cultural patterns and social habits found in China’s largest cities.  The relatively brief chapters range from an overview of the reform era’s numerous institutional changes to more fundamental changes in family and kinship interactions and the rise of women’s social status and related restraints, to the emergence of the new middle class and the value of the pursuit of physical beauty, to the crisis of masculinity experienced most acutely by China’s migrant workers and the rise of popular culture's impact on society.  Two particularly notable chapters are the discussion of the "ant people," or migrants' views of themselves as social and personal failures, and the chapter on the new middle class, which nicely captures some reasons behind the yearning to possess conspicuous consumption goods and experiences.  The book is most suitable for general readers who want to understand something about Chinese society.  If priced right, it could be used as a supplement text in an undergraduate class. **Summing Up:** Highly recommended. Undergraduate collections and general libraries. *--Jankowiak, William R.*
