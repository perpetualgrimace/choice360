### Summary:
Researchers today are challenged with identifying the most relevant papers in a rapidly increasing volume of published research. In addition, restrictions on content sharing impede collaboration. This one-hour interactive webinar will explore the difficulties faced during the research process and introduce two new solutions from Springer Nature that help researchers discover and share content: Recommended, a personalized service that suggests relevant primary research papers to users from across all published literature and SharedIt, a content sharing initiative that allows authors and subscribers to easily and legally share links to view-only versions of research articles anywhere. Demonstrations and examples will be provided to show how these services can be used to support researchers and advance learning at academic libraries.
