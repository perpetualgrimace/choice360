Join us for an in-depth look at Evidence-based Acquisition (EBA) versus Patron-driven Acquisition (PDA) for streaming video. What are the pros and cons of each? When would a library choose one or the other versus other acquisition models?

We share specific case studies of libraries using each, and you’ll discover how your peers are using demand-driven acquisition models to:

- Provide broad access to video.
- Deliver relevant content to patrons.
- Achieve a positive return on investment.
