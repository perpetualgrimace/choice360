The home for entrepreneurship is no longer housed exclusively in business schools. Engineers need to think entrepreneurially to identify and create value in a manner that is comprehensiveâ€”considers the enterprise and business perspectives in addition to the technical specifications. Given the complexity and interconnectedness of contemporary engineering issues, students studying engineering in a vacuum (traditional approach) are less effective. In this one-hour interactive webinar, participants were provided:

- Leadership rationale for cultivating an entrepreneurial mindset in engineering education
- Examples of scalable entrepreneurial programming and initiatives being deployed at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology
- Exposure to resources and tools which assist in the entrepreneurial mindset integration process
