### Summary:

How have social movements taken shape? What was accomplished? How does the past inform today’s events? Primary source collections foster critical thinking skills to help students address these types of questions.

 In this live webinar, you’ll hear from collection curators on how their primary sources come together, how they are used in research and teaching, and their impact on research outcomes. A special focus on the cross-section of the women’s movement and the Black Freedom movement spotlights unique and award-winning resources, including videos, newspapers, books, articles and dissertations.

He is the author or editor of eight books including the prize-winning works, Women at Work: The Transformation of Work and Community in Lowell, Massachusetts, 1826-1860 (1979) and The Face of Decline: The Pennsylvania Anthracite Region in the Twentieth Century (2005).

#### Kathryn Sklar
Distinguished Professor of History, Emerita
State University of New York at Binghamton

Kathryn Kish Sklar is the author of prize-winning books about women and social movements in the United States, 1800-1930. Her research compares American women with British and European women--in the context of imperial movements globally. She is particularly interested in how women's participation in social movements illuminates large questions in U.S. and world history, such as those associated with political culture, class formation, state formation, and the construction of gender, religious and ethnic identities. With Thomas Dublin she has been at the forefront of making primary sources pertaining to women and social movements available online--in Women and Social Movements in the U.S., 1600-2000, an online journal and database; and in two online archives and databases, Women and Social Movements International (completed in 2013), and Women and Social Movements in Modern Empires (to be completed in 2017). She graduated from Harvard/Radcliffe in 1965, completed her PhD at the University of Michigan in 1969, and taught for several years at UCLA before moving to SUNY Binghamton in 1988. In 2005-2006 she was Harmsworth Professor of U.S. History at the University of Oxford. At Michigan and UCLA she chaired the committees that established the women’s studies programs.
