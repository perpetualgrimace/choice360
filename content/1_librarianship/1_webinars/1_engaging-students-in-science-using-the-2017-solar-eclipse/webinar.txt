Jay Pasachoff specializes in studying the sun at total solar eclipses. He and his collaborators carry out experiments to study the million-degree-temperature of the solar corona in order to monitor its dynamics and how it varies with the sunspot cycle, and to provide observations to help distinguish between scientific models of how the corona gets so hot. Their research at the 2017 total solar eclipse is supported by the National Geographic Society and the National Science Foundation. He is the author or coauthor of 26 books/editions, including <i>The Cosmos: Astronomy in the New Millennium (4th edition)</i>, the <i>Peterson Field Guide to Stars and Planets (2016 updated printing of the 4th edition)</i>, and <i>The Sun</i>, which is forthcoming from Reaktion Books/University of Chicago Press in June.
