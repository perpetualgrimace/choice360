### Summary:
Chemistry faculty are often faced with the challenge of finding ways to engage students outside of the classroom with effective learning tools and strategies. The study of substances and how they interact, combine, and change should be anything but static. Students, faculty, and librarians are encouraged to collaborate in the learning process to ensure that time spent in class is more efficient and focused on problem solving and critical thinking skills. This webinar will present strategies for using new 3D chemistry simulation resources in and out of the classroom to increase student efficiency, and improve students’ depth of understanding of the complex topics like the periodic table, molecules and compounds, reactions, and chemical processes.
