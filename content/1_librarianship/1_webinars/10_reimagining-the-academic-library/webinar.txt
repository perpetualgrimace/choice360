Libraries must change their practices and transform their role to maintain centrality in the evolving university environment. Forces confronting university libraries include the shift from print to digital documents, the evolving nature of the scholarly record, the economics of information, and the demographics of the profession. To adapt, libraries must consider the library as place and the retirement of print collections. They must develop the capacity to preserve digital content, reposition the library in the information marketplace, and define the libraryâ€™s job in the age of the smart machine. This webinar presents concrete steps academic libraries should take to advance their place on campus.
