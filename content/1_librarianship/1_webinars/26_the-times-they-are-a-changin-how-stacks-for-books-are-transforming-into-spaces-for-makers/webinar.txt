"We need to remake the perception of our entire library, proving that we’re more than just a warehouse for books,” a librarian from a university in Topeka shared, a goal that many of the 400+ librarians who responded to a recent ProQuest survey about space reclamation priorities are working towards.

 During this session, we’ll walk through the preliminary findings of the survey, providing insight into how libraries are innovating their physical spaces to support hands-on learning.

 We will be joined by Tesse Santoro, Head Librarian, Dobbs Ferry Library at MERCY College and Mark McCallon, Associate Dean for Library Services, Abilene Christian University Library. They will highlight the rising popularity of makerspaces in academic libraries and share the challenges they’ve faced as they’ve evolved to support this trend. We’ll end with a working session that will give you the opportunity to tell content aggregators what types of content your library needs to provide the best level of service possible to your users during these changing times.
