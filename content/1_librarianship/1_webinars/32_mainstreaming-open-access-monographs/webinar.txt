### Summary:
Publishers, vendors, and libraries endorse and fund many open monograph publishing activities, but even as books make their way into open access, digitally-native formats, they frequently remain invisible to end users, or at least hard to find. Often, library management systems and distribution platforms surface only paid electronic or print versions of a book without any indication that an open access version exists. How then do open access monographs achieve the visibility and influence of traditionally published books?

 Join ACRL and Choice for a discussion of these issues and others around open monograph discoverability and distribution from the perspectives of publishers, vendors, and libraries.

Panelists address key questions around open publication and discoverability, such as:

<ul><li> Should open monographs be treated differently from traditionally published books?</li>
<li> How have traditional publication models informed the current system of publication and distribution?</li>
<li> What would it take to integrate open monographs into existing vendor and library workflows?</li>
<li> What are the unstated costs associated with open publication models, and how do they affect publishers, vendors, and libraries?</li>
<li> How can a wider range of libraries keep up with the ever-expanding list of initiatives producing and disseminating open access monographs?</li></ul>
